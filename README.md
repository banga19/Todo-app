Building a todo app that does CRUD operations with postgresql as tha database and flask-sqlalchmey as the server side language 

In summary, here are the skills we'll master  as we build out this application:

  - Traversing across all layers of our backend stack, from our backend server in Flask to our database in Postgres, by understanding mappings between user operations, to the ORM, to the SQL executed on a database.
  - Developing using the MVC Model-View-Controller pattern, for architecting out our application
  - Handling changes to our data schema over time
  - Modeling relationships between objects in our web application
  - Implementing Search
